A web scraper built in Python. This scraper was made for a Non Profit to search the web for 'types' of businesses willing to donate to their foundation.

I created this Python web-scraper for the "Soldier's Angels" military non-profit to locate 'brewery' specific vendors. 
This easy to use scraper can be used to find businesses of a certain "type" making it ideal for recruiters, charities, etc.
